# Beat-em-up Demo (PixiJS + TypeScript)

A simple **2D beat-em-up extract** (Yie-Ar KungFu-like ish early stuff of the beat'em ups) built with [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) and TypeScript. At that time it was v5-v6 and vanilla JS but did some upgrades to use v8 and TS 
This project was created as a technical demo to showcase **game loop design, entity systems, collision handling, PixiJS(WebGL) Javascript game engine and project structure**. Intentionally there are a couple of comments left in the source code so that other than version controlling we can tell some of the challenges faced while upgrading to v8 and refactoring.

## 🎮 Features

- **Player movement** (arrow keys / WASD)  
- **Basic attack system** (player can damage enemy with hitbox: S, Space bar jump attack combo, Q)  
- **Enemy AI**: enemy chases player while alive  
- **Collision system**: player hitbox detects overlap with enemy  
- **Health system**: entities take damage, knockback, and can die  
- **HUD / Health bar** for visual feedback  
- **Entity lifecycle management**: safe cleanup to avoid null reference errors  
- **Project structured by responsibility**:
  - `entities/` → Player, Enemy, BaseEntity  
  - `systems/` → Collision handling  
  - `ui/` → HUD components like health bar  
  - `core/` → Input handling (keyboard)  
  - `main.ts` → Game loop, spawning, high-level orchestration  

- **Next features:** 
1. ~~Assets~~ 
2. Initial screen with music and in game music 
3. Game over screen / retry
4. Collision unit test
5. Custom shader (WebGL)
6. AI and weapongs for different enemies 
7. Explore json atlases for assets switch

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) → 2D rendering  
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) → strong typing & maintainability  
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (or any bundler of choice) → fast local dev server  
- Project is organized in a way similar to larger games (entities/systems separation).
